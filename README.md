### Project is unmaintained (archived)
Petition for archival is a process in 
which a projects state is altered to the "archival" state. In the "archival" state
no organization member shall accept any pull
request or address any issues related to the
repository. A project can be set to the archival state after a period of six months with no pull requests you must however have two organization members or a club officer petition for this. the project can be restored to an active state by an approved appeal to the developers guild president.
